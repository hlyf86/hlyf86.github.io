Growing up in Singapore in the 90s, I flew under the autism radar as I performed well academically. I was streamed into the Gifted Education Programme, where my quirks were accepted by my teachers and peers - many of whom were probably twice exceptional (2e) themselves. Despite being selectively mute and not speaking in school until I was fifteen, I was given plenty of opportunities to pursue my academic interests. I also received enormous amounts of support from my teachers, who accommodated my needs and enabled me to thrive in school. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My goal now as an educator is to pay this forward, to support other neurodivergent learners and enable them to thrive, just as I did when I was younger. Being autistic allows me to naturally connect more easily with my neurodivergent students, due to our shared neurotype and similar ways of being (</span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13623613221129123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read more about the double empathy problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). I also bring a wealth of <a href="https://ndtutor.com/curriculum-vitae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">professional experience and training</a> into my lessons, to ensure that my approaches are evidence-based, neuroaffirming, and effective for the diverse range of learners that I work with. </span></p><hr><h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">My teaching approach</span></h1><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I adapt my teaching approach for each student, finding strategies that work with their unique brains and bodies. These may include, but are not limited to:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporting autonomy: Giving students choice and control, creating a low pressure environment, providing room for flexibility, and making decisions </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them rather than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychological safety: Building an environment of trust and mutual respect, where students feel safe to express ideas, take risks, and make (and learn from) mistakes without fear.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-regulation and co-regulation: Students are encouraged to do what they need to regulate their attention and energy levels, such as using fidget toys, stimming, and taking brain breaks.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diverse modes of expression: All communication modes and interaction styles are valid, and students are welcome to express themselves in ways they feel most comfortable e.g. using written communication, keeping their cameras off.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I work mostly with neurodivergent learners for whom the school system is not providing sufficient support, and require additional individualised support, which I provide. I also work with neurodivergent learners who are outside the traditional school system (e.g. homeschooling, worldschooling) due to it being a poor fit or other reasons.
