This affects not only their performance in maths, but also other subjects (e.g. order of events in history), and their everyday lives in areas such as managing their finances and time. Despite having a prevalence rate similar to that of dyslexia and ADHD, and high rates of co-occurrence, dyscalculia is often underrecognized and underdiagnosed compared to other neurodivergent conditions.</span></p><p><a href="https://dyscalculianetwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find out more about dyscalculia on the Dyscalculia Network (UK-based).</a></p><p><span style="font-size: inherit;">I became interested in dyscalculia when I encountered my first dyscalculic student. Having grown up with a natural aptitude in maths, I found it confounding to meet a secondary student for whom numbers just didn’t make sense. They could memorise formulas and procedures and carry them out mechanically, but would make simple mistakes or be stumped by basic arithmetic. Realising that traditional teaching methods did not work, I went down a rabbit hole seeking to understand why their brain was so different, and how to help. This led to me completing the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ebeorCqsv9DbcSMMaYLWbHQoVLgrA59j/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Certificate in Dyscalculia and Maths Learning Difficulties; Support and Intervention by the British Dyslexia Association.</a></span></p><hr><h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specialist support and intervention<figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy" src="https://ndtutor.com/media/posts/4/mathlink-cubes-2.jpg" alt="Closeup of a student's hands placing Mathlink cubes on a hundreds chart." width="250" height="250" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://ndtutor.com/media/posts/4/responsive/mathlink-cubes-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://ndtutor.com/media/posts/4/responsive/mathlink-cubes-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://ndtutor.com/media/posts/4/responsive/mathlink-cubes-2-md.jpg 768w, https://ndtutor.com/media/posts/4/responsive/mathlink-cubes-2-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure></span></h1><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am currently qualified as a specialist tutor to provide support and intervention for learners with dyscalculia or other maths related difficulties. The intervention I provide helps learners develop a relational understanding of number concepts using the Concrete, Pictorial, Abstract (CPA) approach and multisensory techniques, and rebuild their confidence in maths. Dyscalculia intervention is curriculum independent, and starts where the learner's understanding breaks down, which is often much earlier in the curriculum than where they are expected to be.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teaching strategies and approaches I use will benefit any learner who is struggling with maths, regardless of whether they have a dyscalculia diagnosis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your child is experiencing unexpected difficulties with maths and can benefit from specialist support, do get in touch.</span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://ndtutor.com/contact/" class="btn" style="text-decoration: none;">Contact me for a free consultation</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">© Hannah Leong, The Neurodivergent Tutor</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://ndtutor.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
